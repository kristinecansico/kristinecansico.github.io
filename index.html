            <p align="justify">Happy 21st, my love! I know you're not the type to celebrate birthdays but your birthday is really a special day for me. It is the day in which the most incredible gift and blessing were brought to this world. My love, you are both a gift and a blessing to the people who love and care for you I appreciate every day you exist. I appreciate the fact that you entered my chaotic life unexpectedly and made it worth living. You know how to calm me down especially when I get anxious all of a sudden, to hear your voice was enough to calm me down or to even see you for awhile was enough to make my worries away. You definitely know how to cheer me up, know how to show your support, and to keep me smiling and laughing.The light of your love consistently reassured me that all would be well. I just want to thank you for not just being in my life and for sticking around, but for reminding me that even broken things can be loved. Thank you for being one of my reasons to look forward to the next day. I hope to spend my days in this lifetime by your side and to see you grow everyday. I can't wait to watch you become the best version of yourself. Love, remember that I will always support you in everything you do because I believe that you can do great things as long as you believe in yourself. Baby, whatever and wherever it is, I'll support you on that. Our love is not that shallow. You have me always in all ways.
